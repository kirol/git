=========git: diff between file in local repo and origin===============

Question
I want to find the differences between a file I have in my local repo vs what is in the origin master.

I know that there is git diff, however I just want to isolate it down to this one particular file.

For simplicity lets say the files is named file1.txt and it has a local file path = [local_path] and in the origin it has filepath = [remote-path].

What would be the git command I need to type?

EDIT: Thank you all for your input it has been very insightful. For those that are using Eclipse (which I am and I should have stated earlier) I just found out that you can just rightclick -> Compare With -> Branch, Tag or Reference -> select appropriate version and there you go.




Answer:
If [remote-path] and [local-path] are the same, you can do

git diff origin/master -- [local-path]

Actually, here is a better example: git diff origin/master -- README.md
